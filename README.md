# Pony Language Server

Language server for Pony. See https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol for more information on the language server standard.


## Development

To debug in VSCode, press F5, this will compile both the vscode extension in the client folder and the pony server, using the `build.sh` script.

If pony compilation fails, the process will stop, so you can press F5 without fear.
